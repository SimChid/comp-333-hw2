General functionality:
- To log in, the password entered is hashed in order to match the password stored in the database with the given username.
- When signing in, the system requires a password of 10 characters or more. It is then hashed and stored in the data table.
- On the main page, the user is allowed to view the details of all of the ratings listed on the catalogue, and they can add their own ratings to the catalogue.
- The user is also allowed to update and delete their own reviews to the catalogue, but not to others' reviews.
